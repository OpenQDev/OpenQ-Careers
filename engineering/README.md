# 👷‍♂️🔨 Engineering Opportunities @ OpenQ 🖋👷‍♀️

## About Us

OpenQ provides all the tools needed to explore, sustain and grow your developer community.

For firms crafting the tech landscape with developer tools, APIs, or SDKs, true insight into developer activity is crucial yet elusive. The data is vast, scattered, and sometimes hidden in unknown repos — a complex puzzle of engagement across the digital expanse.

With OpenQ, you provide the tools; we reveal the hands that wield them — every unseen developer move, mapped and distilled into a precise developer fingerprint.

## 🌎 Location

OpenQ is a remote company that meets up IRL multiple times a year to hack/work together.

Our Co-Founders Andrew and Rick live in Austin, TX and Berlin, Germany.

If you're in the area, you're sure to see them in a co-working space often.

## Why No Engineering Hierarchy?

At OpenQ we don't really distinguish between Senior, Mid-Level, Jedi, Level 6, Type 1A3B-Mid or whatever other categories exist to determine pay-levels at most tech companies and governments.

We don't eschew hierarchical engineering titles to be cool and alternative for it's own sake. It's just more efficient, and we all know these designations are often assigned arbitrarily and politicized to silence more junior voices, often to the detriment of the product.

<blockquote>Quality code can come from any person, with any number of years of experience, and even any skill level.</blockquote>

And what we put out at OpenQ is just that - quality code. Everything else but running code is words, and those are cheap.

If you want to say Senior Engineer or Chancellor Engineer, go for it! But have the GitHub history to back up the reputation 😉.

So with OpenQ's HR modus operandi elucidated, let's dig in to how you can put your code-God skills to good use building the go-to platform for Developer Relations specialists.

*Note: All fulltime positions with OpenQ include generous salary, Employee Stock Ownership Plan, and a full benefits package.*

## Why No Fullstack?

<blockquote>
Dear Hiring Managers,

If you are looking for:

– Golang, Python, NodeJS
– React, Vue, Angular, React Native
– PostgreSQL, Redis, MongoDB
– GCP, AWS
– Python, C++, Rust
– ES6, SASS, or Webpack
– Git and CI with TDD, BDD, DDD
– Docker, Kubernetes

That’s not a full stack dev… That’s a whole engineering team #softwareengineering
- Some guy on LinkedIn that got a major ego boost the day he posted this
</blockquote>

While we know that every dev's skills are multifaceted and that many features cross-cut across the stack, it's both unrealistic and inefficient to expect one person to truly have expertise across everything.

When something is everybody's responsibility, it is no ones responsibility. That is inefficient organizationally, and when the metaphorical shit hits the metaphorical fan,  everyone starts pointing fingers.

Anyone at any time is welcome to contribute their time to other parts of the stack! But you will OWN and be responsible for the quality of the part of the stack you will optimize in.
