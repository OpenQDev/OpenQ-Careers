# 👷‍♂️🔨 Engineering Opportunities @ OpenQ 🖋👷‍♀️

## About Us

We generally recommend that anyone who wants to apply for OpenQ reads all our articles on medium to understand our mentality. 
Start here and grab a coffee on a nice rainy Sunday. It will be exciting:
https://medium.com/openqdev/introducing-openq-on-polygon-1b096f74e949

TL;DR 
OpenQ is a permissionless, GitHub-integrated, on-chain work platform tailored for software development feature bounties.

With OpenQ,  **_ANYONE_**  can mint and fund a bounty for  **_ANY OPEN SOURCE ORGANIZATION_**  from a GitHub Issue in seconds at [https://app.openq.dev](https://app.openq.dev/).

That means dApps underpinning DAOs, FOSS packages like Log4j, or any firm with an open source presence.

Contributors can then  **_automagically_**  claim their funds after a maintainer reviews and merges a pull request that completes the issue.

# Some Unique Notes



## The Irony of Bootstrapping a Self-Hosted Compiler for Web 3 Work

It may seem funny that a Web 3 organization founded on alternative funding models for software development would be hiring fulltime developers.

It's like [bootstrapping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootstrapping_(compilers)) a compiler for a new programming language.

To bootstrap a compiler written in the language it's meant to compile, you must first write a compiler for the self-hosted compiler in another language 🤯.

What you will build with OpenQ is the bootstrap compiler for the future of work - starting with software development.

Eventually we intend to manage our entire payroll - from feature+bug bounties, streaming salaries to core developers, provision of invoices - on OpenQ itself. What you will be building is the accounting, governance and project management tools to make that possible, little by little.

## Why No Engineering Hierarchy?

At OpenQ we don't really distinguish between Senior, Mid-Level, Jedi, Level 6, Type 1A3B-Mid or whatever other categories exist to determine pay-levels at most tech companies and governments.

We don't eschew hierarchical engineering titles to be cool and alternative for it's own sake. It's just more efficient, and we all know these designations are often assigned arbitrarily and politicized to silence more junior voices, often to the detriment of the product.

<blockquote>Quality code can come from any person, with any number of years of experience, and even any skill level.</blockquote>

And what we put out at OpenQ is just that - quality code. Everything else but running code is words, and those are cheap.

If you want to say Senior Engineer or Chancellor Engineer, go for it! But have the GitHub history to back up the reputation 😉.

So with OpenQ's HR modus operandi elucidated, let's dig in to how you can put your code-God skills to good use building the future of online collaboration.

*Note: All fulltime positions with OpenQ include generous salary, Employee Stock Ownership Plan, and a full benefits package.*

## Why No Fullstack?

<blockquote>
Dear Hiring Managers,

If you are looking for:

– Golang, Python, NodeJS
– React, Vue, Angular, React Native
– PostgreSQL, Redis, MongoDB
– GCP, AWS
– Python, C++, Rust
– ES6, SASS, or Webpack
– Git and CI with TDD, BDD, DDD
– Docker, Kubernetes

That’s not a full stack dev… That’s a whole engineering team #softwareengineering
- Some guy on LinkedIn that got a major ego boost the day he posted this
</blockquote>

While we know that every dev's skills are multifaceted and that many features cross-cut across the stack, it's both unrealistic and inefficient to expect one person to truly have expertise across everything.

When something is everybody's responsibility, it is no ones responsibility. That is inefficient organizationally, and when the metaphorical shit hits the metaphorical fan,  everyone starts pointing fingers.

That being said, we have regular skillshares (twice a week), encourage all our hires to shoot and write tutorials in which core devs share what they're working on with the rest of the team and community.

Anyone at any time is welcome to contribute their time to other parts of the stack! But you will OWN and be responsible for the quality of the part of the stack you will optimize in.

# The Interview Process

We are 100% transparent at all steps in the interview process.

### Step 1: Apply

Fill out this 5 minute Form with your LinkedIn, GitHub, Twitter, etc.
https://itzldldbwlt.typeform.com/to/m4ujIzU6

### Step 2: 30 Minute Video Interview

No pressure, we won't ask you to reverse a linked list or depth-first search a graph, so you can put away Cracking the Coding Interview.

This convo is to talk shop about your experience, your part of the stack, and to answer any questions you have about OpenQ and the team.

### Step 3: Complete a Paid Bounty with OpenQ

Because OpenQ is itself a contributor-to-core-dev pipeline of sorts, from bounty hunter to trusted inner circle, Step 2 involves completing a paid bounty in your area of expertise - blockchain, backend or frontend.

We've all had the take home coding challenge. This is different - you will actually be contributing the live OpenQ product.

OpenQ, like any developer friendly open source project, is optimized for rapid boot up and tear down. Your task will be to add some functionality.

This will require Docker and docker-compose just FYI :-)

# Engineering Opportunties
