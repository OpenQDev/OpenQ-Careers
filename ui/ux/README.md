## About Us

We generally recommend that anyone who wants to apply for OpenQ reads all our articles on medium to understand our mentality. 
Start here and grab a coffee on a nice rainy Sunday. It will be exciting:

TL;DR 
OpenQ is a permissionless, GitHub-integrated, on-chain work platform tailored for software development.

Translated, this means that we are a marketplace for freelance developers looking for jobs. However, we are reinventing this type of marketplace by not encouraging emerging precarious employment such as the gig economy. Our marketplace is open and free. We want to transition our developers into secure, long-term employment contracts as new opportunities arise on OpenQ.

# Some Unique Notes

## üåé Location

We‚Äôre a remote company that meets up IRL multiple times a year to hack/work together.  
Our co-founders Andrew and Rick live in Austin, TX and Berlin, Germany. If you're in the area, you're sure to see them in a co-working space often.

## The Irony of Bootstrapping a Self-Hosted Compiler for Web3 Work

It may seem funny that a Web3 organization founded on alternative funding models would be hiring people fulltime.

Eventually we intend to manage our entire payroll - from feature+bug bounties, streaming salaries to core developers, provision of invoices - on OpenQ itself. You will contribute to the process. We are going to eventually build the accounting, governance and project management tools to make that possible, little by little.

So yes we will hire people full time and not just build OpenQ by using OpenQ (of course that will be a substantial part at a certain stage of our journey).
And we will probably always have a core team that will generally maintain the platform.

## Why No Hierarchy?

At OpenQ we don't really distinguish between Senior, Mid-Level, Jedi, Level 6, Type 1A3B-Mid or whatever other categories exist to determine pay-levels at most tech companies and governments.

We don't eschew hierarchical titles to be cool and alternative for it's own sake. It's just more efficient, and we all know these designations are often assigned arbitrarily and politicized to silence more junior voices, often to the detriment of the product.

<blockquote>Quality of work can come from any person, with any number of years of experience, and even any skill level.</blockquote>

And what we put out at OpenQ is just that - quality of work. Everything else are empty words for us, and those are cheap.

If you want to say Senior Marketing or Chancellor whatever, go for it!  üòâ. The least you should have is a reference to your work to defend your reputation ;)
OpenQ wants to level the path of an open organization and aims to become a DAO itself. This means that most of the work you will do here will be visible to our community.

This way will be especially exciting for newcomers who would like to experience the entire development process of a DAO. Be it of a legal nature or organizational. You will find a lifelong place here, even if only as a Snapshot voter ;)

So with OpenQ's HR modus operandi elucidated, let's dig in to how you can put your skills to good use building the future of online collaboration.

*Note: All fulltime positions with OpenQ include generous salary, Employee Stock Ownership Plan, and a full benefits package.*

# The Interview Process

We are 100% transparent at all steps in the interview process.

### Step 1: Apply

Fill out this 5 minute form with your LinkedIn, Twitter, etc.
https://itzldldbwlt.typeform.com/to/i5XbUOCR

### Step 2: 30 Minute Video Interview

This convo is to talk shop about your experience and to answer any questions you have about OpenQ and the team.

### Step 3: Complete a Paid Bounty with OpenQ

Because OpenQ is itself a contributor-to-core-dev pipeline of sorts, from bounty hunter to trusted inner circle, Step 3 involves completing a paid bounty in your area of expertise -

Since we are currently a developer centric platform but you are applying for a position outside the code universe, this will be less to prove your code skills (also happy to give you a quick challenge if you still want to prove what your able to code ;) thats a huge plus point) and more to familiarize yourself with the process behind OpenQ. The task will be secondary in that respect.
